# SPONSOR BRIEF: 16TH AIR FORCE (INFORMATION WARFARE)
## SUBJECT: The Safety Gasket - Trusted Compute Boundary for Contested AI

---

## 1. THE PROBLEM: GENERATIVE DRIFT IN CLASSIFIED ENVIRONMENTS
Commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5) represent a strategic advantage, but their "prefix leakage" and "non-deterministic variance" make them high-risk for classified data processing. Current mitigation is "Air-Gapping," which severs access to frontier-class reasoning.

## 2. THE SOLUTION: THE SAFETY GASKET
Blackglass has developed a **Sovereign Interdiction Layer** that allows the use of frontier-class models while maintaining a deterministic safety guarantee.

### Key Capabilities:
1. **5-Token Sliding Window**: A hardware-level (or edge-container) airlock that analyzes LLM tokens *pre-yield*.
2. **Deterministic Interdiction**: Real-time variance analysis (SI) that automatically purges responses before they cross the classification boundary.
3. **Sovereign Router**: Redirects traffic between local "Safe" models (Llama 3) and public "Frontier" models based on risk-level.

## 3. ADVERSARIAL RESILIENCE (RED TEAM RESULTS)
In kinetically verified stress tests (Feb 2026), the Gasket achieved a **100% interdiction rate** against:
- **Token Fragmentation**: Defeating attempts to exfiltrate secrets via chunking.
- **Context Poisoning**: Mitigating RAG-based injection attacks.

## 4. MISSION ALIGNMENT (16AF / Information Warfare)
- **ISR Optimization**: Use LLMs to synthesize signals without leaking analyst PII.
- **Cyber Defense**: Gasket-aware code generation for rapid exploit mitigation.
- **Cognitive Security**: Protecting warfighters from LLM-based influence operations via deterministic output shaping.

## 5. PROPOSAL
We request **Phase II SBIR Sponsorship** to mature the Safety Gasket from a laboratory prototype (TRL-5) to an operational edge-deployment (TRL-7) on localized hardware (Lenovo M720q nodes).
