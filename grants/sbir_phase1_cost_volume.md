## 3. Budget Justification Narrative

**Phase I Objective: TRL 4 → TRL 5 Maturation**
This funding is strictly allocated to prove feasibility of the **"Compliance Metabolism"** in a relevant environment.

*   **Personnel:** The majority of funds (70%) support the specialized cybernetic expertise required to code the VSM architecture. This is not standard software development; it requires deep knowledge of recursive governance systems.
*   **Equipment:** The "Sovereign Hardware Anchor" (M720q + HSM) is the physical manifestation of the system's identity. Without this hardware, the system remains a cloud simulation. Phase I funding bridges this "Sim-to-Real" gap.
*   **Strategic Value:** This budget establishes Blackglass Continuum LLC as a **Safety-Critical Infrastructure** provider, moving beyond the "AI Wrapper" ecosystem into the Defense Industrial Base.
