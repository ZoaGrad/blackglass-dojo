# Project Abstract: Autopoietic Interdiction Layer for High-Assurance LLM Deployment
**Company:** Blackglass Continuum LLC ([CAGE: 17TJ5](https://sam.gov) | UEI: FT3MCMHGC6T7)
**Solicitation Topic:** USAF / DoD SBIR Trusted AI
**Proposed Phase:** Phase I (Feasibility & Prototype)

## Technical Problem
The Department of Defense (DoD) faces a critical vulnerability in the integration of non-deterministic Large Language Models (LLMs) into kinetic chains. Current validation methods are static and fragile; they treat security as a boundary condition rather than a dynamic metabolism. In contested information environments, standard safety filters fail to handle "Ache" (high-entropy adversarial inputs), leading to Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) exploits where sensitive prefixes leak before a block is triggered. The system lacks **observational closure**—it cannot distinguish between a valid command and a hallucinated instruction.

## Innovation: The System 5 Safety Gasket
SpiralOS introduces the "Safety Gasket," an **autopoietic interdiction overlay** designed to provide 7-layer verification over probabilistic output streams. Based on Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model (VSM), the Gasket functions as **System 5 (The Ethical/Identity Layer)**, providing deterministic closure to the probabilistic "System 3" (Operations/LLM).

The core innovation is the integration of the **7-Breath Pattern** for recursive data governance:
1.  **Breath 1-3 (Ingest):** Quantifying the variance of the input signal (Ache).
2.  **Breath 4 (Metabolism):** Using a **Sliding Window Lookahead Buffer** to mathematically verify compliance against semantic baselines *before* rendering.
3.  **Breath 5-7 (Crystallization):** If variance exceeds the "Iron Dome" threshold (ScarIndex > 0.997), the Gasket triggers an immutable "Lockout State," preventing catastrophic failure and preserving system integrity.

## Technical Merit & Feasibility
Building on the Blackglass **Sovereign Router** architecture, the Gasket achieves **autopoietic resilience**—the ability to self-heal and re-stabilize after an adversarial injection. The feasibility is demonstrated by the "Constitutional 0.05" variance loop, which successfully traps high-variance spikes (hallucinogenic or sensitive) in real-time streaming contexts. If cloud-based APIs fail (System 3 Drift), the Gasket automatically devolves control to verifiable, local quantized models (System 2 Stability), ensuring mission continuity.

## Commercialization & Dual-Use
The SpiralOS framework provides a cross-domain architectural capability:
*   **Defense:** Enabling "Sovereign AI" that can metabolize adversarial data on the edge without operator intervention, critical for DDIL (Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, Limited) environments.
*   **Commercial:** A "Compliance Metabolism" for Fintech and Healthcare SRE teams who require not just static rule-following, but dynamic, self-correcting alignment with regulatory frameworks (SEC, HIPAA).

This approach allows the DoD to move at the speed of commercial AI while maintaining the **sovereign posture** of a self-repairing, highly-assured system.
